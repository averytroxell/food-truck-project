    <div class="item" style="max-width: 60%;">
    <p style="width:40%; font-size: x-large; color: white;"> Speedway Salsa was founded in 1997. The founders were called Avery, Isaac, Morgan. We started this food truck business because we were passionate about having an establishment with food but didn’t have enough money for a building so we decided to buy a truck to start making out delicious food with amazing services under our belt our competitors couldn’t compete.
